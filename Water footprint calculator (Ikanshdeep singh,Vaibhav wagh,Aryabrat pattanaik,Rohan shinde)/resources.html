        <h2>1. Indian Standard
            CODE OF BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR WATER SUPPLY, DRAINAGE AND SANITATION</h2>
        <p>This Indian Standard (Fourth Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Water Supply and Sanitation in Building Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.
            This Indian Standard was first published in 1957 and subsequently revised in 1963, 1971 and 1983. In this revision, requirements of water supply for residences has been listed based on population of the community. However, for Lower Income Group (LIG) and Economical Weaker Section of Society (EWS), the value of minimum requirement of water supply has been retained as 135 litres per head per day. Fire demand in buildings has been catered to, by giving reference to a suitable standard.           
            This code represents a standard of good practice and, therefore, takes the form of recommendations.</p>

        <h3>By Ministry of Jal Shakti (INDIA)</h3>
        <p>Water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1816 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively which may further reduce to 1486 cubic meters and 1367 cubic meters in the years 2021 and 2031 respectively.</p>

        <h2>4. How much water does a person use a day?</h2>
        <h3>By WorldoMeter</h3>
        <p>Explains the worldwide, agriculture accounts for 70% of all water consumption, compared to 20% for industry and 10% for domestic use. In industrialized nations, however, industries consume more than half of the water available for human use. Belgium, for example, uses 80% of the water available for industry.</p>

        <h2>5. Estimation of water requirement for drinking and domestic use</h2>
            <h3>By CENTRAL GROUND WATER AUTHORITY </h3>
        <p>The value of water supply given as 150 to 200 litre per head per day may be reduced to
            135 litre per head per day for houses for Medium Income Group (MIG) and Lowe Income Groups
            (LIG) and Economically Weaker Section of Society (EWS), depending upon prevailing conditions
            and availability of water.
            Out of the 150 to 200 litre per head per day, 45 litre per head per day may be taken for flushing
            requirements and the remaining quantity for other domestic purposes.</p>
